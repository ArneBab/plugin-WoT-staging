/**
 * A real simple unit test for {@link SynchronousDelayedBackgroundJob}.<br><br>
 * 
 * ATTENTION: This test will not by run by the build script by default! It is only run if Ant is
 * executed with parameter "-Dtest.unreliable=true".<br>
 * This is because this test is timing sensitive, and thus may fail randomly on slow machines.
 * See <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=6521">the relevant bugtracker entry</a>.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * TODO: Code quality: This mostly tests the thread-safety of triggerExecution(). Lacking tests:<br>
 * - Thread-safety and reliability of terminate() / waitForTermination(). Tests should be added to
 *   ensure that they work when concurrently called with triggerExecution().<br>
 * - Reliability of triggerExecution(). Tests should be added to ensure that it always causes an
 *   actual execution if one has the right to be scheduled.<br>
 * Notice: The best way to improve this class likely is to re-use the most of
 * {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJobTest}, maybe via a common base class.
