- 0006929: [Bugs] Travis CI builds fail due to changes at fred (xor)

  The .travis.yml configuration of Travis CI has been fixed to be
  compatible to the huge changeset of the Freenet core fred which is
  being developed on fred's next branch.
  Specifically it was adapted to be compatible with the new Gradle
  builder of fred which has replaced Ant there - while keeping Ant at
  WoT so we don't have too much migration efforts going on for now.

  The unit tests of WoT do succeed against the new fred code so
  hopefully WoT won't delay the release of the fred changes any further
  than they have already been delayed.
  This also the first time where the "CI" = continuous integration
  in Travis CI is really happening to meet its definition:
  I don't have a Gradle build setup for fred branch next yet so it is of
  true benefit to be able to test it elsewhere :)
  Thanks to nextgens for insipiring this by setting up Travis CI at
  fred!

- 0007016: [Bugs] Fix unit test failure on Java 9 (xor)

  Fixes a bug in the unit tests, not in the actual code.
  Symptom was:
    junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: static final boolean
    plugins.WebOfTrust.Persistent.$assertionsDisabled expected not same

Thanks to:
  - ArneBab for being willing to review and deploy WoT.
  - nextgens for Travis CI.
