/**
 * Implementation of delayed background jobs where {@link #triggerExecution} blocks until the
 * background job has finished, as if the background job was performed synchronously. This
 * class is intended to be used in unit tests, and is likely not very useful for general purposes.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * Can be used during startup of Freenet plugins to replace {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJob}.
 * This can be necessary because during startup, the {@link PluginRespirator} is not be available to
 * plugins immediately. Because of that, they cannot access the node's {@link Executor} and
 * {@link Ticker}, and thus should not construct a {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJob} to avoid
 * having to construct a duplicate Executor / Ticker.<br><br>
 * 
 * Notice: Be aware that its {{@link #triggerExecution()}} will block until the job's execution
 * completes. This can cause deadlocks if the job's thread tries to acquire locks which the thread
 * which is calling triggerExecution() is holding: The job will be run on a separate thread, so it
 * doesn't own the locks of the triggering thread.<br>
 * If that problem affects you, you can use the other possible replacement for
 * {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJob} which is {@link MockDelayedBackgroundJob}; or change
 * your code to call {@link #triggerExecution()} after all locks are relinquished.<br><br>
 *
 * ATTENTION: The unit tests for this class will not by run by the build script by default! They
 * are only run if Ant is executed with parameter "-Dtest.unreliable=true".<br>
 * This is because the tests are timing sensitive, and thus may fail randomly on slow machines.
 * See <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=6521">the relevant bugtracker entry</a>.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * TODO: Code quality: This rather complex class could maybe be simplified by extending
 * {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJob}. IIRC, the only difference it has to that class is that
 * {@link #triggerExecution(long)} shall wait for the job to complete. That could be implemented
 * by wrapping the job which is passed to the parent {@link TickerDelayedBackgroundJob} in a
 * wrapper class which helps {@link #triggerExecution(long)} to wait for it to complete.
